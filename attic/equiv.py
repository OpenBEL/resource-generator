 equiv.py

 Construct each of the .beleq files, given a particular dataset.
 This involves gathering all the terms and determining whether
 or not there are existing terms that refer to the same thing.
 Terms are either then equivalenced to something else, or given
 a new uuid (but UUIDs should be preserved after the first run).
